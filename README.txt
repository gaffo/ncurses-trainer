An example of using NCurses to make a simple application.

Compiling:

./linux 

Which will compile the application, to run the base app, do:

./invaders

Which will launch the app.

The goal of the project is to provide as straight forward an example of using NCurses as possible. I hope to build it in the form of several increasingly complicated applications using all of the features of NCurses. However, for now it's just a simple app using just the basic functionality.
